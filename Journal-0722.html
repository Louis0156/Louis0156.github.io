    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
            <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO, </li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM,</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    July 14, 2012 I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
    </blockquote>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars. June 2, 2012
    <img src="images/segway2.jpg" alt="swgway2"> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone, </li>
        <li>iPod, digital camera, </li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
        <li>Just the essentials. </li>
        As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
    </ul>
